# Don't put same string data in twice - use relationship instead

# Primary key - particular row / unique number

# Eg: album's primary key ends up being Track's foreing key ( bc the track belongs to the album)

# Make senseble name - eg:
# album's primary key ID ( id ) could be in Track's foreing key ID ( album_id )

# Logical key -  unique id to get item from outside

# Table - Primary key - Logical key - Foreing key
